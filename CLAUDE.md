# OwnSpace

User-owned knowledge space — one source, your control, zero fragmentation.

## Specs

Consult `specs/` before implementing features or making changes:

- `specs/dev/rules.md` — commit message format, co-authorship, signing

If code changes affect what specs describe, update the relevant spec file accordingly.

## Architecture Decisions

ADRs are stored in `docs/decisions/`. Use adr-tools conventions.
